Sub-Basin using SWAT Model</h1>
<p> <a href= "index.html"> Previous Page </a> </p>

<h2> Data Input for SWAT Model</h2>
<p> The Input data required for SWAT such as, Digital 
Elevation Model (DEM), Land Use Land Cover (LU/LC), Soil data, 
Hydro-meteorological data were either prepared or procured 
from different sources. </p>

<h3> Digital Elevation Model (DEM) </h3>
<p> Digital Elevation Model is the basic unit for the catchment delineation process 
in SWAT and used to determine the drainage network of the 
landscape and parameters affecting the basin. For the present 
study, CARTOSAT-1 DEM (30 m x 30 m resolution) was 
downloaded from <a href= "http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/home/index.php">ISRO’s Bhuvan website </a> . The 
DEM shows highest elevation as 761 m and lowest as 66 m 
of study area. The study area's northern and southern parts are 
having low elevation range while the greater altitude is 
observed in the eastern and western parts. DEM was used to 
obtain slope, direction of flow and accumulation, network of 
streams and outlet points. </p>

<h3> Land Use Land Cover
<img class="maps2" src="DEMmap.jpg" alt="DEM map of Study Area" width="550" height="450">
</h3>

<p> <img class="maps1" src="landusemap.jpg" alt="LULC map of Study Area" width="550" height="550"> Landsat-8 (Land Satellite 8) imagery is used to prepare Land 
use map which was downloaded from 
<a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/"> USGS Earth Explorer website </a>. The study area is classified into 7 
classes having attributes spatial resolution of 30 meter in 
WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_43N projection. They are follows: 
(1) Deciduous forest area, (2) Agriculture area, (3) Pastures , 
(4) Range bushes, (5) Urban area, (6) Barren area and (7) 
Water bodies.</p>

<h3> Meteorological Data </h3>
<p> Daily minimum temperature (℃) and maximum 
temperature (℃) data were collected from State Water Data 
Centre (Gandhinagar). Rainfall data of Deo dam and 
Shivrajpur rain-gauge stations were collected for the years 
2000-2017. Deo dam weather station was chosen for 
temperature data and model period was set to be 2000 to 2017 
due to unavailability of previous years datasets. Daily inflow 
data from 2002-2017 was collected from the office of Deo 
dam. </p>

<h3> Soil data and Slope/Topograpghy of the area </h3>
<p> The characteristics of the soil are required to be known for 
the estimation of runoff. SWAT model can take ten-layer soil 
data as input, there was only two-layer information provided 
here owing to data unavailability. As model inputs are required for some soil 
properties such as texture, moisture content, hydraulic 
conductivity, physical characteristics, hydrologic soil group 
and bulk density are required which are to be given in the 
form of database table for SWAT. Soil data was downloaded from Food and Agricultural (FAO) organization webpage. In the study region, two 
kinds of soil with texture loam and clay are discovered as shown in map. Watershed was divided in five slope class ranges with 55% of 
watershed area falling in slope range of 0-10% as shown in map attached.

<h3> Water Balance Components of Deo River 
Sub-basin Generated by SWAT Check </h3>
<p>
 Water Balance Components of Deo River Sub-Basin 
Generated by SWAT are shown in figure. It can be said that from total precipitation, 
49% is obtained as surface runoff, 13% as percolation, 36% 
as evapotranspiration and 1% as deep recharge and lateral 
flow. So, 49% of precipitation flows as surface runoff. Curve 
number value obtained is 84.91 which is near to 100 so it 
indicates that runoff will be more.

  </table>
<p> Average monthly observed and simulated runoff of Deo river basin are shown by table . Table result shows that in the months of 
June, July and August simulated runoff (Runoff calculated after running this Hydrological Model )(Runoff measured in Million Cubic Meter)is more than observed runoff (Actual Runoff),
while in the months of September and October observed runoff is more than simulated runoff.</p>


<p class="note"> <b>Note:</b> Other months are not considered because there were no rainfall events which eventually generates zero runoff. </p>
