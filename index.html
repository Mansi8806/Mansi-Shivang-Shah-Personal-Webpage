	<h2> Brief Introduction </h2>
<p> The current research analyses the runoff response using 
Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) during rainfall incidents 
over the sub-basin of Deo River, Panch Mahal, Gujarat, India.
The SWAT model is developed for the Deo river sub-basin having 
catchment area of 194.36 km <sup>2</sup>
, with 7 sub-basins comprising of 94 
Hydrological Response Units (HRUs). Two rain gauge stations 
present in the study area (viz., Deo dam and Shivrajpur) 
werechosen to evaluate the efficiency of the SWAT model.</p>

<h2> What is SWAT? </h2>
<p> SWAT is a continuous daily deterministic time-step model used to assess land-management procedures in basins.
ArcSWAT, which is embodied in ArcGIS, is a graphical user interface for SWAT (SOIL AND WATER ASSESSMENT TOOL) model.
The actual aim of developing this model is to predict the impact of land management practices on water, runoff values
in large complex watershed with varying soil, 
land use and management conditions over a long period of time. </p>

<h2> Research Objectives </h2>
<ul> <li>To use GIS techniques for simulation of surface runoff and water balance study of Deo dam basin.</li> 
<li>DEM (Digital Elevation Model) based watershed delineation. </li>
<li>To classify HRUs using ArcSWAT tool based on spatial data Land use, soil type and slope variation. </li>
<li>To analyse the watershed characteristics.</li>
<li>To assess the different components of water balance for the Deo dam basin.</li> 
<li>To develop the model of the study area for the years 2000 to 2012.</li> </ul> 


<h2>Study Area Location and Description
<img class="maps2" src="Images/subbasins.jpg" alt="Sub-basins map of study area" width="500" height="450"> </h2>
<p> Deo river is selected for the present study which flows in 
Dahod, Panch Mahals and Vadodara districts of Gujarat, India (Location shown in Map). Deo 
river is the right bank tributary of the Dhadhar river. Its other 
name is Dev river in the name of god. At 26 km distance Deo 
dam is located on Deo river having catchment area of 194.36 
sq. km., which is selected as study area. The basin lies 
between 22° 22΄ N to 22° 31΄ N latitude and 73° 30΄ E to 73° 
42΄ E longitude. The average annual precipitation is 1072 
mm (42.21 inches) in the basin. The maximum average 
temperature felt here is of 39℃ in the month of May and the 
minimum average temperature of 13℃ for the month of 
February. The average annual wind speed recorded at the 
Deo dam weather station is 6.53 m/s. The map showing sub-basins and dam location is created which is attached here. </p>
 
<h2> Model Set-up and Methodology of SWAT Model 
<img class="maps1" src="Images/flowchart.jpg" alt="Location of Study Area" width="550" height="450"> </h2>

<p> The main steps involved in GIS interface of ArcSWAT are 
Watershed delineation, HRU analysis, Write Input Tables 
(weather data) and SWAT run. Flow chart of SWAT model is 
shown in the figure. </p>

<p> Watershed is delineated with DEM as main input and for 
HRU analysis Land use map and soil map are required. HRU 
(Hydrologic Response Unit) is a distinctive mixture of land 
use, soil and slope characteristics. 94 HRUs were generated 
giving thresholds of 5% for land use, 5% for soil and 10% for 
slope. Then rainfall (mm) and maximum and minimum 
temperature (℃) were given as input for SWAT Run. At last 
SWAT run is performed entering the starting and ending date 
of simulation, Print-out setting set to daily and the number of 
warm up years. Finally SWAT check was run to get the 
details of Water balance in the Deo river sub-basin. </p>

<h2> Google Static Maps </h2>
<p>Google static maps are shown below for 2 weather stations location whose meteorological data are used for study.
1st weather station location is shown in map of India having red label which is near Deo dam. While 2nd weather station location
is shown in the zoomed in map having green label.</p>
